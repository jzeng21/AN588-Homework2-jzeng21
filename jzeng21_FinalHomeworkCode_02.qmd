## Question 1

```{r}
lambda <- 15 #I setted 15 as the mean calls here

greater_eight <- ppois(8, lambda) #using ppois function 
print(paste("P(X > 8) = ",greater_eight)) #printed the results, I used print paste because there is both a string and numerical value in the print so it needs to be able to take both types.
```

## Question 2

```{r}
no_calls <- ppois(0, lambda) 
print(paste("P(X = 0) = ", no_calls))
```

## Question 3

```{r}
three_calls <- ppois (3, lambda)
print(paste("P(X = 3 = ", three_calls))
```

## Question 4

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # I used ggplot 2 for a better visual

x_vals <- 0:30
poisson_pmf <- dpois(x_vals, lambda) #by using dpois you are able to get the exact values of x_vals, ppois would have given the probabilties against another x value
poisson_df <- data.frame(x = x_vals, probability = poisson_pmf)

ggplot(poisson_df, aes(x = x, y = probability)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue", color = "black") + 
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) +  
  labs(title = "Poisson Probability Mass Function", x = "Number of Calls", y = "Probability") + #labs just means labels
  theme_minimal() #just made the theme of the plot more clean 


```

## Question 5

```{r}
set.seed(123) # setting the seed is important because it basically functions as a limiter to the randomization. If you don't set the seed you will baisically get random numbers everytime
tyear_calls <- rpois(10^4, lambda) 
tyear_calls #just printing the results, it is a bit large
```

## Question 6

```{r}
hist(tyear_calls, breaks = 30, col = "blue", border = "black",
     main = " Histogram of 2 year simulation",
     xlab = "Number of calls", xlim = c(0, 30), probability = TRUE) #Used hist function to create a simple hist graph
```

## Final Thoughts:

1\) This is still new to me put I learned a lot from my peer comments and homework.

2\) Some challenges I faced was how to set proper chart properties and making sure that very large codes looked readable.

3\) One of my current biggest challenge right now is actually still working on how to make my homework look pretty and also I am having trouble working on integration of github. I am still trying to figure out on how to push proper peer comments and how to push seperate files in differentiating the final vs original homework code..

4\) In homework 3 I am to perfect all my issues and I hope that I myself can see the change.
