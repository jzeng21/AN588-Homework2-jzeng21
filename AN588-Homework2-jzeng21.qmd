## Question 1

```{r}
lambda <- 15 #I setted 15 as the mean calls here

greater_eight <- ppois(8, lambda) #using ppois function 
print(paste("P(X > 8) = ",greater_eight)) #printed the results, I used print paste because there is both a string and numerical value in the print so it needs to be able to take both types.
```

## Question 2

```{r}
no_calls <- ppois(0, lambda) 
print(paste("P(X = 0) = ", no_calls))
```

## Question 3

```{r}
three_calls <- ppois (3, lambda)
print(paste("P(X = 3 = ", three_calls))
```

## Question 4

```{r}
library(ggplot2) # I used ggplot 2 for a better visual

x_vals <- 0:30
poisson_pmf <- dpois(x_vals, lambda) #by using dpois you are able to get the exact values of x_vals, ppois would have given the probabilties against another x value
poisson_df <- data.frame(x = x_vals, probability = poisson_pmf)

ggplot(poisson_df, aes(x = x, y = probability)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue", color = "black") + 
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) +  
  labs(title = "Poisson Probability Mass Function", x = "Number of Calls", y = "Probability") + #labs just means labels
  theme_minimal() #just made the theme of the plot more clean 


```

## Question 5

```{r}
set.seed(123) # setting the seed is important because it basically functions as a limiter to the randomization. If you don't set the seed you will baisically get random numbers everytime
tyear_calls <- rpois(10^4, lambda) 
tyear_calls #just printing the results, it is a bit large
```

## Question 6

```{r}
hist(tyear_calls, breaks = 30, col = "blue", border = "black",
     main = " Histogram of 2 year simulation",
     xlab = "Number of calls", xlim = c(0, 30), probability = TRUE)
```
