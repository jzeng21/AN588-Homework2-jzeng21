This topic is still quite new to me, but I’ve learned a lot through both the assignments and reading feedback from my peers.

One challenge I faced was setting appropriate chart properties in ggplot2 to make my plots informative and clean. I also struggled with formatting long chunks of code in a way that was readable and well-organized.

A major ongoing challenge is improving the visual polish of my homework submissions. I’m still figuring out how to better structure my work and improve the overall appearance. Additionally, I’m working on understanding how to integrate GitHub more effectively—especially how to push peer comments properly and organize separate files like the original versus final versions of my homework.

Looking ahead to Homework 3, I’m aiming to resolve these issues. My goal is to see clear improvements not only in my code and visuals but also in my workflow and presentation. I want to be able to reflect on the progress I've made.
